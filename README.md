# Chirp_OOK
Chirp-OOK by using Back-scatter communication.
***
The Chirp-OOK project aims to provide a demo for moulating and demodulating [Chirp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp).
Of course, I also used the usrpN210 to generate signal data and successfully accepted it.
## Features
1.	This project uses matlab to generate the chrip signal for simulation.

2.	Demodulate in two ways.
- Downchrip related
- FRFT([Fractional Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Fourier_transform))

3.	I successfully experimented with usrpN210.

## Running
The current work is just a demo.So you can run the <font style="color: #0000FF ">demodulate.m</font> to simulation.
Of course you can uncomment some code in your code to use real data.

## Changelog
V1.1 :yum:
